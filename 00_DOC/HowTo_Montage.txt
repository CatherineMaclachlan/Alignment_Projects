====================
Assemble materials
====================

To get started, we need to assemble:
- Project folder, we'll call it DEMO in this tutorial.
- Parameter folder and file.
- Input data file.
- Topmost scipt.

+++++++
Folders
+++++++

# Manually...
> mkdir DEMO
> mkdir DEMO/prms

++++++++++
Parameters
++++++++++

Copy parameter set from here:
???/Alignment_Projects/macros/matchparams_BockEM.txt

Rename it and place it here:
DEMO/prms/matchparams.txt

++++++++++
Input File
++++++++++

Get copy of script to concatenated Rick files from here:
???/Alignment_Projects/macros/catlyr.sht

Edit catlyr.sht as needed. For example, for 200 layer Bock stack I did this:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
dir=/nobackup/bock/eric/zz200/130818-layouts/

for z in $(seq 879 1088)
do
	N=$(printf "%04d" $z)
	cat $dir$N".bill.txt" >> Z879-1088.txt
done
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Make data file
> ./catlyr.sht

++++++++++++++
Topmost script
++++++++++++++

> cp ???/Alignment_Projects/1_TopScripts/topgo.sht DEMO/topgo.sht

Edit topgo.sht, especially to name input file and layer range:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
topscripts Z879-1088.txt -idb=idb0 -zmin=879 -zmax=1088 -nf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

===================
Begin processing
===================

+++++
topgo
+++++

> ./topgo.sht

This creates several new sht scripts:
- crossgo, dbgo, mongo, upmongo.

However, to make montages alone, we only need:
- dbgo, mongo.

++++
dbgo
++++

Next we convert the input Rick file or XML into an image database. Edit dbgo.sht as needed (e.g. add cropping file option -crop=mycropfile).

> ./dbgo.sht

Read makeidb.log file for any error messages.

+++++
mongo
+++++

Mongo.sht examines the input tile positions and pairs up tiles that have sufficient overlap. Sublists of tile pairs are distributed into several 2D grid cells we call blocks, and these are labeled Sx_y. Mongo creates a subfolder for each block and writes a make file 'make.same' within each that lists tile pairs to match. Each cluster node gets at most two make files to process.

Before running, edit mongo.sht to add options '-davinc -minareafrac=0.01'.

> ./mongo.sht

Read makemontages.log file for any error messages.

========================
Submit make.same files
========================

Enter the work folder created by mongo.

> cd temp0

Each layer is tiled by several blocks, and if there are many layers one could overfill the job submission queue. Get the cummulative count of blocks in a layer range, using:

> countsamedirs.sht 879 1088

If the number exceeds 20,000 then do subranges, like this:

> ./ssub8.sht 879 988
# ...wait for enough jobs to finish...
> ./ssub8.sht 989 1088

Enqueued jobs are named by pattern 'qSx_y-z' where (x,y) are block indices and z is the layer index.

Periodically check for completion of all jobs.

> qstat

=====================
Sanity check points
=====================

> ./sreport.sht 879 1088

This creates three report files:
- SameErrs.txt
- SameNopts.txt
- SamePts.txt

SameErrs: Each line is the size (from ls command) of the stderr file for a make.same. These lines should all report zero file size. Note that when jobs are submitted via make files, a fatal error not only kills results for that pair of images, but further kills the whole make file. Errors of this type are quite significant.

SameNopts: Each line is a block (z/Sx_y subdir) whose make file produced no points. This is a severe error usually caused by a bad path or a very bad parameter value. This report should be entirely empty, unless you know the sample is so bad in a region that getting no points there is rational.

SamePts: Each line is a file size (from ls) of the pts.same file for a block. Since mongo does a good job of balancing the sizes of make files we expect good consistency for the number of points found in all parts of a montage, and even all parts of a volume. An outlier point count is suspicious.

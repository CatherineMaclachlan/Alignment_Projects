=========================
Add Environment Variable
=========================

All the make files have an include statement:
"include $(ALN_LOCAL_MAKE_PATH)/aln_makefile_std_defs".

You have to copy the file:
"00_ENV/aln_makefile_std_defs"

from your git folder to somewhere else so that git will not overwrite it. This is your private copy of the file. It contains full paths you should edit according to where your project folder lives. There are also paths into Lou's directory that should work for anyone at Janelia. I didn't need to get special permission or group membership to see these.

Finally, add an environment variable to your bash_profile like this:
"export ALN_LOCAL_MAKE_PATH=/groups/~location_of_my_std_defs"

====================
Edit .bash_profile
====================

Our bash_profile includes these lines:

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Alignment specific definitions
#

# Set path for local builds
export ALN_LOCAL_MAKE_PATH=/groups/apig/tomo

# Set universal mrc image file margin
export MRC_TRIM=12

# Set our locally built binaries path
# and append Lou's cluster-bins path
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
PATH=$PATH:/groups/apig/tomo/lou_stuff/binaries
PATH=$PATH:/groups/scheffer/home/schefferl/cluster-bins
export PATH

# Set place to look for libpng14 library
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib64
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

#
# End alignment definitions
# ---------------------------------------------------------
